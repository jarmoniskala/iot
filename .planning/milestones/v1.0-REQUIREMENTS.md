## v1 Requirements (All Complete)

### Data Pipeline

- [x] **PIPE-01**: Supabase edge function receives HTTP POST from Ruuvi Station Android app and stores sensor readings
- [x] **PIPE-02**: Edge function validates incoming sensor data (known MAC, realistic ranges, deduplication)
- [x] **PIPE-03**: FMI API polled on schedule via pg_cron + pg_net (every 10 min) and stored in database
- [x] **PIPE-04**: FMI XML/GML response parsed correctly for Helsinki-Vantaa airport station (FMISID 100968)
- [x] **PIPE-05**: Database storage usage monitored and displayed on dashboard
- [x] **PIPE-06**: Supabase project kept alive (prevent 7-day inactivity pause)

### Live Dashboard

- [x] **LIVE-01**: User can see current temperature, humidity, and pressure for each room (bedroom, kid's room, living room)
- [x] **LIVE-02**: User can see current outdoor weather from FMI (temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, precipitation, cloud cover)
- [x] **LIVE-03**: User can compare indoor vs outdoor readings side-by-side
- [x] **LIVE-04**: Each sensor shows "last updated X minutes ago" with visual warning if data is stale
- [x] **LIVE-05**: Each sensor shows battery level indicator (low/ok/good)
- [x] **LIVE-06**: Dashboard is mobile-responsive (works well on phone screens)
- [x] **LIVE-07**: Dashboard supports dark mode toggle

### Historical Data

- [x] **HIST-01**: User can view historical trend charts (line charts) for temperature, humidity, and pressure per room
- [x] **HIST-02**: User can select time range via presets (24h, 7d, 30d) and custom date range picker
- [x] **HIST-03**: User can overlay multiple rooms on the same chart for comparison
- **HIST-04**: Charts show visual markers where data gaps exist — **DEFERRED to v2** (requires RELY-01 Raspberry Pi gateway for continuous data; infrastructure built but rendering intentionally not connected)
- [x] **HIST-05**: User can view daily/weekly summary stats (min, max, average) per room

### System Health

- [x] **HLTH-01**: Dedicated system health view shows battery voltage trends per sensor
- [x] **HLTH-02**: System health view shows signal strength (RSSI) per sensor
- [x] **HLTH-03**: System health view shows movement counter and last-seen timestamps
- [x] **HLTH-04**: System health view shows measurement sequence gaps (data loss detection)

### Computed Insights

- [x] **COMP-01**: Dashboard shows dew point calculated from temperature and humidity per room
- [x] **COMP-02**: Dashboard shows absolute humidity per room
- [x] **COMP-03**: Dashboard shows comfort classification per room (dry/comfortable/humid/very humid)
